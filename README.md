# General

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles for 2020.

I've chosen C# because .NET 5 is the new shiny, and Visual Studio made it
pretty easy to get rolling with it. I'm not actually sure if I'm going to end
up making use of any C# 9 features, but .NET 5 is supposed to have a pretty
massive speed-up over previous versions, so solutions go brrr.

Anyways, if you'd like to run this you'll need the .NET 5 SDK installed.

Using Visual Studio 2019 you can run it as follows:

1. Open the Solution
2. Right-Click the desired day project and select "Set as Startup Project"
3. Execute the program with F5
4. Marvel

You should be able to run it with the dotnet 5 sdk, but I keep getting framework
pack issues...

# Goals

* Solve the problems.
* Write clear code that communicates the intent.
* Use nifty constructs when applicable.
* Code should go brrr for the most part.

# Contributions

I will accept contributions for spelling errors and things along those lines,
but probably won't accept any contributions that overhaul the code in any major
way.
